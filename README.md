DSA with Java: 🚀
A dedicated space where I document my daily progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. What started as a #100DaysOfCode challenge has now become a lifelong habit of problem-solving.

About me:
Experienced Manager making a strategic pivot to Software sector.
For 2+ years, I managed complex projects in the automotive body shop (planning, budgeting, new line construction, and quality stabilization). This background taught me the value of systematic problem-solving and results-driven execution—skills I'm now applying to code.
I'm currently focused on mastering in Full-Stack Principles | Core Java & Front-End Technologies, diving deep into OOP and data structures. I'm excited about the career change and eager to build scalable software. 

🕊️ The Philosophy
"Consistency beats intensity."
I'm not just learning to code; I'm learning to think. Thanks for following my journey!
